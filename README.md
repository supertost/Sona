<p align="center">A Spotify media controller built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android Devices that does not need the Spotify Web API to work.</p>

---

## What it does

- Play/Pause music playing on Spotify
- Skip or go to the previous song
- Open Spotify to add the playing song to your like list, add new songs to queue, or change what's playing

It works nicely with Spotify Connect, allowing you to listen to your music from other devices while controlling playback from this app.

## Requirements
- As this app does not use the Spotify Web API, the Spotify app has to be downloaded and open in the background for this app to function properly
- Requires Android 12+ (API 31 and above).

## Program in action

| Skip tracks | Play/Pause with a nice animation | Open Spotify to do more actions |
